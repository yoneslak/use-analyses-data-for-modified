Analysis code to find out life in planets and moons:
Changes:

A new habitability score column has been added to the dataset, which is calculated based on planetary properties.
Changed the load_planetary_data() function to include the new column.
Added a new function calculate_habitability_scores() to calculate habitability scores based on planetary properties.
Modified the visualize_habitability_scores() function to visualize habitability scores.
Changed the visualize_correlation_matrix() function to include
This code loads planetary data, calculates habitability scores, and visualizes the results using seaborn and matplotlib.
In this code, first, with the help of the planet calculator function, we check the planets' habitation scores based on the bell characteristics.
After that, we will visualize the resulting features by seaborn functions.
We will form a matrix and check the correlation between the planets.
The correlation between planetary traits and the presence or absence of life on planets is a complex and multifaceted issue.

Diameter and mass: Larger planets with more massive cores have stronger gravitational forces, which can lead to:
Increased atmospheric retention potentially enhances life-supporting conditions.
More intense volcanic activity, which can provide energy sources for life.
More likely plate tectonics that could create diverse environments and promote the emergence of life.
Orbital period and surface temperature: Planets with shorter orbital periods have the following:
Higher surface temperatures make it more challenging for life to emerge and grow.
An increase in stellar radiation that can be harmful to life.
However, some planets with shorter orbital periods may have more stable climates and potentially support life.
Atmosphere and habitability: The presence and composition of an atmosphere can significantly affect habitability:
A stable atmosphere can regulate temperature, maintain a stable climate, and protect against harmful radiation.
The presence of oxygen, methane or other biomarkers can indicate biological activity.
An atmosphere with high levels of greenhouse gases can lead to sudden warming and reduce the likelihood of life.
Moons and Habitability: Moons can affect the habitability of planets in several ways:
Tidal forces can create stable, habitable environments on moons, such as Europa's subsurface ocean.
Moons can stabilize the axis of their home planet, leading to a more favorable climate and increased habitability.
The presence of multiple moons can increase the probability of planetary collisions and decrease the probability of life.
Correlation between planetary features: Relationships between these features can have a profound effect on habitability:
A planet with a large diameter, moderate surface temperature, and stable atmosphere may be more likely to support life.
A planet with a short orbital period, high surface temperature and thin atmosphere may be less likely to support life.
While these correlations are fascinating, it is important to remember that the origin and persistence of life on a planet is influenced by several factors, including:

The presence of liquid water
Organic chemistry and availability of energy resources
The distance of the planet from its star and the energy output of the star
The presence of a strong magnetic field to protect against harmful radiation
Geological activity of the planet and the existence of a stable crust
The search for life beyond Earth is an ongoing and multidisciplinary endeavor. As we continue to explore the universe, we may discover new correlations and relationships that shed light on the mysteries of the origin of life and the conditions necessary for its emergence.
